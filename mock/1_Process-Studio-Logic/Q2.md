## Study the following process flow:

- [P1](png/Q2_1.png)
- The calculation stage adds the data item 'A' to the data item 'B' and stores it in data item 'C'.
- Assume the calculation stage and data items have been set-up correctly.
- What will happen if this page is executed?

1. The process will terminate.
2. The logic will fail because there is no logic between the Recover and Resume Stages.
3. The missing link will cause an internal exception which will be recovered. No value will be stored in data item 'C'.
4. The missing link will cause an internal exception which will be recovered. The value 8 will be stored in data item 'C'.

## Answer : 4

## Reasons : 
- Even though the Calculation Stage has no link connecting to the End Stage, the stage still executes and throws an internal exception as no link exists.
